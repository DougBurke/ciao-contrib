	The check_ciao_version tool allows users to easily
	check that the CIAO and 
	CIAO Calibration Database (CALDB) installations are up
	to date. It compares the dates of the installed components
	against the latest-released versions and prints out those
	elements that need upgrading.
	The script requires internet access
	since it has to download the version information from the
	CIAO and CALDB web sites.
      </PARA>
      <PARA title="Tool behavior">
	The tool prints messages to the screen and exits with a status
	of 0 when everything is up to date or non-zero when 
	something needs updating.
      </PARA>
      <PARA title="How do I upgrade my system">
	If the tool finds that your CIAO or CALDB installations are out
	of date then it will point you to the
	<HREF link="http://cxc.harvard.ed/ciao/download/">download CIAO
	page</HREF>, from which the ciao-install script can be
	downloaded. This script will perform the necessary updates.
