Usage:
  acis_clear_status_bits evtfile

Aim:

Resets the STATUS column of evtfile for use in chandra_repro/standard processing
of ACIS event files introduced in CIAO 4.4.

Sets the bits 1-5, 14-20, and 23 to 0 (False).

The edits are made in place and so will not work if the input file
is gzip-encoded. There is no check that the input file is valid other than
that it contains a STATUS column.

Aim:

Clear the status bits in an ACIS events file set by the pipeline
and that are not cleared by acis_process_events.

There is no parameter file for the tool as there is only one parameter,
the events file to change (note that it is changed in place and so
the file needs to be uncompressed before use).

This script has been added to support re-processing Chandra data using
the bad-pixel/afterglow pipeline. Please see the
"Reprocessing Data to Create a New Level=2 Event File" thread at

  http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/createL2/
