    <SYNOPSIS>
      comptonization of a seed spectrum.
      XSpec convolution model 
      *Experimental*.

      <PARA>
	The SIMple Power Law model:
	An empirical model of Comptonization in which a fraction of
	the photons in an input seed spectrum is scattered into
	a power-law component
	(<HREF link="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PASP..121.1279S">Steiner
	et al. 2009, PASP, 121, 1279</HREF>).
	It is designed for use with soft thermal spectra that
	are not Compton thick and that have a photon index
	<EQUATION>Gamma > 1</EQUATION>
	Simpl offers the advantage of operating in a self-consistent
	manner, linking the seed spectrum to the generated power law.
	Compared to powerlaw, simpl gives equally-good fits
	while also employing just two parameters, and simpl has the
	virtue of eliminating the divergence of powerlaw at
	low energies. Because simple redistributes input
	photons to higher (and lower) energies, for detectors
	with limited response matrices (at high or low energies),
	or with poor resolution, the sampled energies should be
	extended to adequately cover the
	relevant energy range (for details and an example, see the
	appendix in Steiner et al. 2009).
