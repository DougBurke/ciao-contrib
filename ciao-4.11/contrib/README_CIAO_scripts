CIAO. Refer to the individual script ahelp files for software version
and calibration requirements.

INSTALLATION

Overview
========

The CIAO scripts package is a tar archive that is designed to be
unpacked from the directory which contains the CIAO installation.
If you do not have write permission in your CIAO installation, you 
will need to ask your system administrator to install these scripts.

The tarfile unpacks into the "contrib" subdirectory of $ASCDS_INSTALL.
Within $ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib, the script files are distributed among
several subdirectories.  (If $ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib or any of its
subdirectories do not exist, tar will create them.)  The directories
and their associated contents are as follows:

$ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/bin
    Executable scripts

$ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/lib/python3.5/site-packages/
$ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
    Python scripts and functions (at present the python2.7 version
    is a soft link to the python3.5 directory)

$ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/share/doc/xml
    XML documentation files for individual scripts, viewable in 
    the CIAO ahelp system

$ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/param
    Parameter files for scripts with parameter interfaces

$ASCDS_INSTALL/contrib/data
    Files used by the scripts and libraries provided by the
    package

Instructions
============

1) Start CIAO

The installation instructions are given relative to the CIAO
environment variable $ASCDS_INSTALL.  You need to be in a window
running CIAO so that this variable is defined.

2) Unpack the tarball

Note: the CIAO installation (i.e. $ASCDS_INSTALL) is assumed to be
into a directory named ciao-<version>/ since this is where the files
will be unpacked.

    unix% cd $ASCDS_INSTALL
    unix% cd ..
    unix% tar xvf /downloads/ciao-<version>-contrib-<number>.tar.gz


3) Re-index the ahelp database

This step allows ahelp (the CIAO help system) to find the
newly-installed script XML files.

    unix% ahelp -r

See "ahelp ahelp" for more information on this command.

If this is the first installation of the contrib package into
CIAO then the CIAO start-up script should be re-sourced, adding
the "-o" flag, to pick up the new paths. For instance,

    unix% source $ASCDS_INSTALL/bin/ciao.csh -o    # csh/tcsh
    unix% . $ASCDS_INSTALL/bin/ciao.bash -o        # bash
