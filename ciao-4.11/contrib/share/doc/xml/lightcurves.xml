    <DESC>
      <PARA>
	The lightcurves module provides two Python routines that can be used to
	remove periods of high (or low) count rates in a lightcurve.
	The first - lc_clean() - is designed for use with the ACIS
	background files and is based on the lc_clean program created by
	Maxim Markevitch. The second - lc_sigma_clip() - is a simple
	sigma-clipping routine. See
	"ahelp lc_clean" and "ahelp lc_sigma_clip" for more information
	about the individual routines.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The routines are usable from the command line using the
	deflare tool, as described by "ahelp deflare".
      </PARA>

      <PARA title="Loading the module">
        The module can be loaded into a Python
	interpreter - such as chips, sherpa, or ipython
	- by saying:
      </PARA>

<VERBATIM>
from lightcurves import *
</VERBATIM>

      <PARA>
	This only needs to be done once per session (when using
	an interactive shell such as chips or sherpa). Loading
	the module will make available the lc_clean and lc_sigma_clip
	routines.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>
	The two routines use different algorithms to detect flares
	in a light curve. Both are intended to be used with data that
	has relatively high count rates (i.e. ones in which bins are not
	expected to have no counts in them). The default mode is to
	create a plot showing the selected periods of the light curve,
	and to display the filter on screen. They can also be used to
	create a GTI file which encodes this information and 
	can be used to filter the event file to remove these periods.

	    Filter the light curve in the file bg.lc using the lc_clean algorithm

      <PARA>
	The routines are designed to work with light curves that were
	created using the CIAO dmextract tool, run with the opt parameter set
	to ltc1. They should however also work with any file which has the 
	following columns:
      </PARA>
      <LIST>
	<ITEM>TIME</ITEM>
	<ITEM>TIME_MIN and TIME_MAX (optional)</ITEM>
	<ITEM>COUNT_RATE or, if not present, RATE</ITEM>
	<ITEM>EXPOSURE (optional for lc_sigma_clip, required for lc_clean)</ITEM>
      </LIST>
      <PARA>
	If the file contains OBJECT and OBS_ID keywords then these will be
	used to label the plot.
      </PARA>

    <ADESC title="Changes in the December 2011 release">
      <PARA>
	The routines have been updated to work with CIAO 4.4.
