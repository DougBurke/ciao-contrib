"""Create a spectrum file for use in MARX.

Helper routines for creating a spectrum file for use with
`MARX <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/marx/>`_.

Examples
--------

>>> load_pha('src.pi')
>>> notice(0.5, 7)
>>> set_source(xsphabs.gal * xsapec.src)
>>> set_stat('wstat')
>>> fit()
>>> plot_marx_spectrum()
>>> save_marx_spectrum(outfile='marx.dat', clobber=True)

                      norm=None):
    """Return the spectrum in the form needed by MARX.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : int or string or None
        If id is None then the default Sherpa id is used. This
        dataset must have a grid and source model defined.
    elow, ehigh, ewidth : number or None
        Only used if all three are given, otherwise the grid
        of the data set is used. The elo value is the start
        of the low-energy bin, ehigh is the end of the high-energy
        bin, and ewidth the bin width, all in keV.
    norm : number or None
        Multiply the flux values by this value, if set.

    Returns
    -------
    (energ_hi, flux_bins)
       The energies are in keV and fluxes in photons/cm^2/s.

    Notes
    -----
    The bins are supposed to be continuous and the value of energ_hi
    for one bin is use as the lower boundary of the next bin. MARX
    ignores the first bin the input file since its lower boundary is
    not specified.

    It is possible for the start or end bin to exceed the
    desired energy limit. For example, if::

        elow=2
        ehigh=2.5
        ewidth=0.2

    then the bins will be 2-2.2, 2.2-2.4, 2.4-2.6. The error
    introduced by this is assumed to be significantly smaller than
    other errors in the calculation (such as how well the source
    spectrum is actually known).

    The source model is assumed to be defined on an energy grid,
    with units of keV, and evaluate to photon/cm**2/s per bin.
    This is true of the XSpec models and 1D Sherpa models.


    Examples
    --------

    >>> load_pha('src.pi')
    >>> set_source(xsphabs.gal * powlaw1d.pl)
    >>> gal.nh = 0.09
    >>> pl.gamma = 1.25
    >>> pl.ampl = 8.432e-5
    >>> (xlo, xhi, y) = get_chart_spectrum()

    See `get_chart_spectrum` for information on the other
    arguments supported by this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    outfile : string
        The name of the file to create. It is no-longer possible
        to use None to get the output displayed to the screen.
    clobber : bool, optional
        If the output file already exists, should it be deleted
        (``True``) or an IOError raised? The default is ``True``.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Should a message be displayed indicating that the file
        has been created? This is only used when outfile is not
        ``None``.

    Notes
    -----
    The format needed for ChART2 is three columns - low and
    high energy values along with the spectrum - and can be in
    any Data-Model supported format (so both ASCII and FITS).
    This is different to version 1, which required a 2 column
    ASCII file.
